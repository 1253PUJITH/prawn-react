This highly contagious virus spreads rapidly in shrimp farms through contaminated water, infected shrimp, equipment, and carrier species like crabs and wild crustaceans.The disease is characterized by the appearance of white, calcium-like spots on the exoskeleton of infected shrimp, lethargy, loss of appetite, and high mortality within a few days of infection. WSD outbreaks are often triggered by sudden temperature fluctuations, poor water quality, overcrowding, and stress.WSD can cause mass mortality in shrimp farms within 3 to 10 days, leading to severe economic losses. Since there is no specific cure for WSD, farmers must focus on prevention through biosecurity measures, disease-resistant shrimp strains, and maintaining optimal environmental conditions. Early detection and immediate action, such as isolating infected shrimp, can help control the spread of the disease.\",\n  treatment: \"There is no effective treatment for White Spot Disease, making prevention and management essential. Farmers should implement strict biosecurity measures to prevent the virus from entering their farms. Using specific pathogen-free (SPF) shrimp and disinfecting all equipment and water sources can significantly reduce the risk of infection.Maintaining stable water quality is crucial to preventing stress-induced outbreaks. Regular monitoring of water temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels can help create a healthy environment that reduces shrimp susceptibility to infections. Sudden environmental changes should be avoided, as they can weaken shrimp immunity and increase the risk of WSD.Infected shrimp should be removed immediately to prevent the spread of the virus. Draining and disinfecting affected ponds before restocking is essential to eliminate any viral particles. Using probiotics and immune-boosting feed additives can help enhance shrimp resistance to infections.Some studies suggest that natural antiviral agents, such as seaweed extracts and immunostimulants, may help strengthen shrimp defenses against WSSV.
