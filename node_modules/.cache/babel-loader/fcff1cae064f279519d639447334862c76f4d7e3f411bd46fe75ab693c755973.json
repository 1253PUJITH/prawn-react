TSV primarily spreads through contaminated water, infected shrimp, and predator species such as birds and crabs. Environmental factors like poor water quality, overcrowding, and temperature fluctuations increase the risk of outbreaks. The disease has three phases: 1. **Acute Phase:** Shrimp develop soft shells, reddish discoloration, and erratic swimming behavior. Mortality is highest at this stage. 2. **Transition Phase:** Some shrimp start to recover, but dark melanized spots may form on their shells. 3. **Chronic Phase:** Infected shrimp appear normal but remain carriers of the virus, posing a long-term risk to farm populations.

The disease affects the shrimp’s gills, reducing their ability to extract oxygen from the water, leading to respiratory distress, reduced growth, and increased mortality. Affected shrimp often become lethargic, weak, and may float near the water surface due to oxygen deprivation. In severe cases, Black Gill Disease can cause mass mortality in shrimp farms. Since the disease can be caused by multiple factors, proper pond management, good aeration, and maintaining optimal water conditions are critical for prevention.

TSV primarily spreads through contaminated water, infected shrimp, and predator species such as birds and crabs. Environmental factors like poor water quality, overcrowding, and temperature fluctuations increase the risk of outbreaks. The disease has three phases: 1. **Acute Phase:** Shrimp develop soft shells, reddish discoloration, and erratic swimming behavior. Mortality is highest at this stage. 2. **Transition Phase:** Some shrimp start to recover, but dark melanized spots may form on their shells. 3. **Chronic Phase:** Infected shrimp appear normal but remain carriers of the virus, posing a long-term risk to farm populations. TSV is one of the most economically damaging diseases in shrimp farming due to its rapid spread and high mortality rates.

Water quality plays a crucial role in preventing stress-induced infections. Shrimp ponds should be well-aerated, and ammonia, nitrite, and pH levels should be regularly monitored to ensure a stable environment. Keeping water temperatures consistent reduces stress on shrimp and lowers the risk of infection. Selective breeding programs have developed TSV-resistant shrimp strains, which offer a long-term solution for affected farms. Using probiotics and immune-boosting feed additives can help strengthen shrimp immunity and reduce susceptibility to infections.

IHHN often causes runt deformity syndrome (RDS), where infected shrimp exhibit bent or deformed rostrums and uneven growth rates. Severe infections lead to high mortality, particularly in *P. stylirostris*, while *P. vannamei* usually survives but suffers from reduced growth and productivity. The disease is widespread in shrimp farms globally and can cause significant economic losses due to poor shrimp quality and lower market value.
